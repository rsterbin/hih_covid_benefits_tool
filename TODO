Need before launch:
* Better sessions + redux
    * Use context to pass the token to children?
        // const TokenContext = React.createContext(null);
    * Use react-idle-timer to trigger token updates?
        // https://github.com/SupremeTechnopriest/react-idle-timer

Nice to have:
* New resource button on the resources list page that respects the current benefit
* Add a component for the language plain text editor so it can have token replacement too
* Tests
