        "Good news: your employee can access some benefits to offset the disruption this crisis is causing them. Domestic workers are a vulnerable population who have minimum protections under the law. Though protections have been extended to many workers during the COVID-19 crisis, protections are not permanent and employees may only be covered for 10 days of paid leave. Many domestic workers fall through the cracks and are unable to sustain themselves. For domestic employers, there is a safety net to access, but for domestic workers, employers are their safety net. We appreciate your commitment to protecting your {{employee_type}} as they support you.",
        "Here are the benefits available to your {{employee_type}}.  Some of these require you to pay for the benefit; others are funded by the government. We understand that it's difficult to have this responsibility fall on you. That's why we advocate for real protections for domestic workers, and better protections for all of us.  Just as we want our government to treat us fairly when a crisis like this puts a stable financial situation out of reach, we also want our employees to have fair treatment, even when as employers, we're also struggling.",
        "You can't control the economic situation, but you can control whether you're building a fair working relationship with your {{employee_type}}. Be sure to open a conversation about these benefits with honesty and sensitivity for the situation your {{employee_type}} is facing."
