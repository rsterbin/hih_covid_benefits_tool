# Hand-In-Hand's COVID-19 Benefits Tool

Domestic workers do the work that makes all other work possible. It's crucial
to recognize the work of nannies, house cleaners and home attendants who are on
the frontlines of our response to COVID-19.

This tool makes it easier for employers to discover what benefits their
employees are entitled to, and provides links to find out more or apply.

**NB:** This tool is currently a DRAFT.

## Notes

* The script `misc/matrix.pl` helps determine how many scenarios our question
  set is generating. Eventually, I can use it to generate a CSV for Amalia to
  fill in.
